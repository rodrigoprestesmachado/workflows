/**
 * This package contains the repository interfaces for the workflow system.
 * These interfaces define the methods for interacting with the database,
 * including CRUD operations for the various entities in the workflow system.
 *
 * The repository interfaces extend Spring Data JPA repositories, providing
 * a high-level abstraction for database interactions and reducing the need
 * for boilerplate code.

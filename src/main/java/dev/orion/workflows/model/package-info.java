/**
 * This package contains the model classes for the workflow system.
 * These classes represent the core entities and their relationships
 * within the workflow system, including workflows, executions, controls,
 * services, and history records.
 *
 * The model classes are annotated with JPA annotations to define the
 * mapping between the Java objects and the database tables. They also
 * use Lombok annotations to reduce boilerplate code for getters and setters.

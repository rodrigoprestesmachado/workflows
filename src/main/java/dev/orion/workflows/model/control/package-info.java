/**
 * This package contains the control classes for the workflow system.
 * These classes represent the various control structures that can be used
 * within a workflow, such as conditional branches, loops, and wait states.
 *
 * The control classes extend the base Control class and are distinguished
 * by their specific types, such as Go, Wait, Loop, and If. Each control
 * class provides specific functionality and behavior that can be used to
 * define the flow of execution within a workflow.
